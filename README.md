# PBP Ride Analysis

In August 2023, I did a 1200km Paris Brest Paris ride in under 90 hours. I wanted to evaluate my ride and see areas of improvements. Wrote this app to evaluate the .fit file for a ride and plot moving time, banked time, breaks etc in a line and bar charts. 

It also compares performance of fellow riders in a strava flyby type of comparison.
